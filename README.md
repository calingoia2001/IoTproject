# IoTproject
This IoT project retrieves data from the Waze API, saves it locally as a .json file, uploads it to AWS S3, and sends an SMS notification when the severity parameter exceeds the threshold of 3. The script captures Waze alerts, prints relevant details, checks severity for SMS notification, saves data to a .json file, and uploads it to AWS S3.
